Advertisements? Will these expand over time with increase in IM Leagues popularity?

What is it written in?

WYZIWYG editor?

How is admin handled?
	Easy to add/revoke/edit access?

Database? What happens if their system fails?

Transitioning from current system to theirs? Time/problems?

If I want a change -- is it possible to make it myself, even if I'm not technically-minded? What kind of changes would require me to contact IM Leagues versus doing it myself?

Is it possible to "mess up" my site? Ie break something? What happens if I break something or want to undo a change I've made?

Can I expect to see updates from IM Leagues that affect the look and feel of my site or make it difficult for me to adapt to?
